# MapGL

## Introduction

MapGL is a spigot plugin, it's goal is to offer an OpenGL api to allow graphics programming inside a minecraft map.

## Project status

The project is currently at a **very early stage** consisting of limited functionality.

## Goals

At this early stage of the project the goal is to add the basic functionality for drawing a colored triangle and quad, this includes:
- [x] OpenGL context
- [x] Vertex buffers (VBOs)
Vertex Arrays (VAOs)
- Element buffers (EBOs)
- Shaders
- Graphics pipeline (shaders, rasterization, etc)

After the basic building blocks of OpenGL are done the goal is to continue expanding the implementation, offering more functions from the specification (like textures for example) and with this create basic sample games with it.
